# Qubo
This repository consists of our submission for the Crypto.com next gen student hackathon. Qubo is our solution for the first problem statement: "How might we grow participation in Web3/Crypto through financial inclusion?".

**Problem:** 60% of customers have a subscriptions service. Crypto payments are growing at a rapid rate, yet there is a dearth of APIs for SaaS companies to leverage to support non-fiat subscriptions

**Solution:** Qubo is a plug-and-play payment service provider for merchants to accept crypto transactions with subscription support and inventory management tools

# Architecture
The frontend is built using react, the backend is built with go. 

The subscriptions functionality is implemented on a smart contract and we have a node middleware built to interact with the smart contract.
